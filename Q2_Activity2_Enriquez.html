<div class="div1">
	<p class="Para1">He who plants a tree
	Plants a hope.<br>
	Rootlets up through fibres blindly grope;<br>
	Leaves unfold into horizons free.<br>
	So man's life must climb<br>
	From the clods of time<br>
	Unto heavens sublime.<br>
	Canst thou prophesy, thou little tree,<br>
	What the glory of thy boughs shall be?</p>

	<p style="color: white;">He who plants a tree
	Plants a joy;<br>
	Plants a comfort that will never cloy;<br>
	Every day a fresh reality,<br>
	Beautiful and strong,<br>
	To whose shelter throng<br>
	Creatures blithe wih song.<br>
	If thou couldst but know, thou happy tree,
	Of the bliss that shall inhabit thee!</p>

	<p style="color: white;">He who plants a tree,--<br>
	He plants peace.<br>
	Under its green curtains jargons cease.<br>
	Leaf and zephyr murmur soothingly;<br>
	Shadows soft with sleep<br>
	Down tired eyelids creep,<br>
	Balm of slumber deep.<br>
	Never has thou dreamed, thou bless√®d tree,<br>
	Of the benediction thou shalt be.</p>

	<p style="color: white;">He who plants a tree,--<br>
	He plants youth;<br>
	Vigor won for centuries in sooth;<br>
	Life of time, that hints eternity!<br>
	Boughs their strength uprear:<br>
	New shoots, every year,<br>
	On old growths appear;<br>
	Thou shalt teach the ages, sturdy tree,<br>
	Youth of soul is immortality.</p>

	<p style="color: white;">He who plants a tree,--<br>
	He plants love,<br>
	Tents of coolness spreading out above<br>
	Wayfarers he may not live to see.<br>
	Gifts that grow are best;<br>
	Hands that bless are blest;v
	Plant! life does the rest!<br>
	Heaven and earth help him who plants a tree,<br>
	And his work its own reward shall be</p>
